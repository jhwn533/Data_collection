      "Objective:To explore the clinical effect and safety of internal fixation of steel-wire limited loop in early Achilles tendon rupture.Methods:Seventy-six patients respectively with early transected and avulsed types of Achilles tendon rupture were selected and treated with internal fixation of steel-wire limited loop. The patients began to take exercise for their lower limbs through continous passive motion as early as possible after surgical repair, and the loops were removed after 3-5 months. Six months later, the condition of complications including Achilles tendon re-rupture, wound fistula, wound infection and skin necrosis, cutaneous sensation in sural nerve dominance region, time back to preinjury work or learning as well as time to physical activities were observed. One year later, the therapeutic effect was evaluated, and the maximum circumferences of bilateral legs and ruptured plane circumferences of Achilles tendon were measured.Results:The wound of all patients healed well, no complications like Achilles tendon re-rupture, wound fistula, wound infection and skin necrosis occured, and the cutaneous sensation in sural nerve dominance region was normal. The mean time back to preinjury work or learning as well as to pysical activities of all patients were respectively 10 and 22 weeks. Seventy out of 76 patients (92.1%) achieved an excellent effect, and 6 (7.9%) good effect. The excellent and good rate came up to 100%. The maximum circumference in the affected leg decreased to 2 mm averagely compared with the offside, while the ruptured plane circumferences of Achilles tendon in the affected side increased to 2.2 mm compared with the offside.Conclusions:For early Achilles tendon rupture, internal fixation of steel-wire limited loop can recover the ankle function better, return to the preinjury state in the shortest time, and has few complications.\n"

      "Daniel Hauser\n",
      "Biological structures have emerged through millennia of evolution, and nature has fine-tuned the material properties in order to optimise the structure-function relationship. Following this paradigm, polydopamine (PDA), which was found to be crucial for the adhesion of mussels to wet surfaces, was hence initially introduced as a coating substance to increase the chemical reactivity and surface adhesion properties. Structurally, polydopamine is very similar to melanin, which is a pigment of human skin responsible for the protection of underlying skin layers by efficiently absorbing light with potentially harmful wavelengths. Recent findings have shown the subsequent release of the energy (in the form of heat) upon light excitation, presenting it as an ideal candidate for photothermal applications. Thus, polydopamine can both be used to (i) coat nanoparticle surfaces and to (ii) form capsules and ultra-small (nano)particles/nanocomposites while retaining bulk characteristics (i.e., biocompatibility, stability under UV irradiation, heat conversion, and activity during photoacoustic imaging). Due to the aforementioned properties, polydopamine-based materials have since been tested in adhesive and in energy-related as well as in a range of medical applications such as for tumour ablation, imaging, and drug delivery. In this review, we focus upon how different forms of the material can be synthesised and the use of polydopamine in biological and biomedical applications.\n"

The primary targets for the prevention of musculoskeletal injury in sport include neuromuscular training (NMT), rule modification, and equipment recommendations. Currently, there is significant high-quality evidence to support the widespread use of NMT warm up programs in team and youth sport, with an expected significant impact of reducing the risk of musculoskeletal injury by over 35%. Policy disallowing body checking in youth ice hockey has led to a >50% reduction in injuries, and rules limiting contact practice in youth American football has significant potential for injury prevention. There is evidence to support the use of bracing and taping in elite sport to reduce the risk of recurrent ankle sprain injury but not for use to prevent the primary injury, and wrist guards are protective of sprain injuries in snowboarding. Future research examining the maintenance of NMT programs across real-world sport and school settings, optimization of adherence, additional benefit of workload modification, and evaluation of rule changes in other sports is needed.'"

    ">> Healthy aging is the ability to maintain independence, purpose, vitality, and quality of life into old age despite unexpected medical conditions, accidents, and unhelpful social determinants of health. Exercise, or physical activity, is an important component of healthy aging, preventing or mitigating falls, pain, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and cognitive impairment. A well-balanced exercise program includes daily aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility components. Most older adults do not meet the currently recommended minutes of regular physical activity weekly. Counseling by health care providers may help older adults improve exercise habits, but it is also important to take advantage of community-based exercise opportunities.\n",

    ">> AbstractHealthy aging is the ability to maintain independence, purpose, vitality, and quality of life into old age despite unexpected medical conditions, accidents, and unhelpful social determinants of health. Exercise, or physical activity, is an important component of healthy aging, preventing or mitigating falls, pain, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and cognitive impairment. A well-balanced exercise program includes daily aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility components. Most older adults do not meet the currently recommended minutes of regular physical activity weekly. Counseling by health care providers may help older adults improve exercise habits, but it is also important to take advantage of community-based exercise opportunities.Keywords:Exercise; Healthy aging; Older adults; Physical activity.\n",
